                    Hi! i am Katherine Lyn A. Suarez
                </h1>
                <p>I am currently a first year college student in University of the East and my course is Bachelor of Science in information technology, I chose this course because I am passionate about becoming a game developer when I graduate. I have a lot of achievements in my favorite sports and that is taekwondo, I am currently a red belter and still training to become better. My hobbies are playing sports, playing games, and helping people that are in need. I am currently here studying because of my family that supports me so I can be what I want when I graduate they are my motivation in my daily life without them I wouldn't be here studying. So I have to study better to make them proud.</p>
